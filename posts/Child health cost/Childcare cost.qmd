# Goal: Predict the cost of childcare in US counties based on various characteristics of each county.

The emphasis of this project is on the utilization of tidymodels framework for the optimization of an xgboost model through [early stopping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping#:~:text=In%20machine%20learning%2C%20early%20stopping,training%20data%20with%20each%20iteration.), employing the current week’s #TidyTuesday [dataset](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-05-09) on childcare expenses in the United States.

## Exploratory data analysis

In this dataset, there are numerous variables that could potentially serve as predictors. When dealing with large datasets with many variables, some of which are strongly correlated, I frequently use xgboost as a modeling algorithm due to its effectiveness.

Before we proceed with the modeling, it’s beneficial to conduct some exploratory data analysis. Specifically, we’re interested in understanding how the **mcsa** (the median weekly cost for school-aged children in childcare centers) has evolved over time.

```{r}
# Calculate the lower and upper bounds for outliers
childcare_costs |>
  ggplot(aes(study_year, mcsa, group = study_year, fill = study_year)) +
  geom_violin(alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Blues")

```

Let us visualize how are childcare costs related to `mhi_2018` (median household income) and `flfpr_20to64` (labor force participation for women).

```{r}
childcare_costs |>
  ggplot(aes(mhi_2018, mcsa, color = flfpr_20to64)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10() +
scale_color_distiller(palette = "Spectral")+ theme_minimal() 
```

In counties with lower income levels, the cost of childcare is observed to be relatively stable, while in counties with higher income levels, an escalation in childcare costs is noted. Furthermore, a higher prevalence of women participating in the workforce is seen in high-income counties.

Let's check the racial composition of these counties.

```{r}
childcare_costs |>
  select(mcsa, starts_with("one_race"), mhi_2018) |>
  select(-one_race) |>
  pivot_longer(starts_with("one_race")) |>
  ggplot(aes(value, mcsa, color = mhi_2018)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(name), scales = "free_x") +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Spectral")+ theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "% of population")
```

In counties with a higher Black population (one_race_b), it is observed that both household income and childcare costs are lower. Conversely, in counties with a higher White population (one_race_w), both household income and childcare costs are seen to be higher. A trend appears to exist in counties with a higher Asian population (one_race_a), where an increase in the Asian population is associated with higher childcare costs. It is important to note that these relationships are not causal, but rather, they are indicative of the intricate interplay between race, socioeconomic class, and geographical location in the U.S.

## Building a model

The initiation of our modeling process involves the establishment of our “data budget.” In this instance, the prediction target is mcsa (the costs associated with school-age children in childcare centers), necessitating the removal of other childcare cost measures related to babies, toddlers, and family-based childcare, among others. The FIPS codes, which explicitly encode location, are also to be removed, shifting the focus to county characteristics such as household income and the number of households with children. Given the substantial size of this dataset, it is [suggested](https://www.tmwr.org/resampling.html#validation) that a single validation set be utilized.

```{r}
library(tidymodels)

set.seed(111)
childcare_split <- childcare_costs |>
  select(-matches("^mc_|^mfc")) |>
  select(-county_fips_code) |>
  na.omit() |>
  initial_split(strata = mcsa)

childcare_train <- training(childcare_split)
childcare_test <- testing(childcare_split)

set.seed(222)
childcare_set <- validation_split(childcare_train)
childcare_set
```

Given that all predictors are already in numeric form, there is no requirement for any special feature engineering; a formula such as mcsa \~ … can be utilized. However, there is a need to establish a tunable xgboost model specification with [early stopping](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/regularization-by-early-stopping/). The number of trees will be maintained as a constant (and not excessively high), the stop_iter (the early stopping parameter) will be set to tune(), and a few other parameters will be tuned. It should be noted that a validation set needs to be established (which in this case is a proportion of the training set) to be reserved for determining when to stop.

```{r}
xgb_spec <-
  boost_tree(
    trees = 500,
    min_n = tune(),
    mtry = tune(),
    stop_iter = tune(),
    learn_rate = 0.01
  ) |>
  set_engine("xgboost", validation = 0.2) |>
  set_mode("regression")

xgb_wf <- workflow(mcsa ~ ., xgb_spec)
xgb_wf
```

The model is prepared for deployment. The next step involves adjusting various hyperparameters using the training set, which includes a subset reserved for early stopping, in addition to our validation set.

```{r}
doParallel::registerDoParallel()
set.seed(234)
xgb_rs <- tune_grid(xgb_wf, childcare_set, grid = 15)
xgb_rs
```

## Evaluating results 

Let's see how this turned out.

```{r}
autoplot(xgb_rs)
```

Visualizing the top results

```{r}
show_best(xgb_rs, "rmse")
```

The optimal Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is slightly over \$20. This value provides an estimate of the accuracy with which we can predict the median childcare cost in a US county, given that the median cost in this dataset was approximately \$100.

We will now employ the **`last_fit()`** function to fit the model one last time using the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data, utilizing the numerically optimal result obtained from **`xgb_rs`**.

```{r}
childcare_fit <- xgb_wf |>
  finalize_workflow(select_best(xgb_rs, "rmse")) |>
  last_fit(childcare_split)

childcare_fit
```

Let's see how did this model perform on the testing data, that was not used in tuning or training.

```{r}
collect_metrics(childcare_fit)
```

Most important features for the target variable in this xgboost model.

```{r}
library(vip)

extract_workflow(childcare_fit) |>
  extract_fit_parsnip() |>
  vip(num_features = 15, geom = "point")

```

In this model, significant influences are exerted by the percentage of the county’s population identified as Asian, the median income of households, the median earnings for women, the year, and the total number of households in the county.

## Deploying the model

Object created for deploying the model.

```{r}

v <- extract_workflow(childcare_fit) |>
  vetiver_model("childcare-costs-xgb")
